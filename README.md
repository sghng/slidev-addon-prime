# slidev-addon-prime

An addon that brings [PrimeVue](https://primevue.org) components to
[Slidev](https://sli.dev).

## Known Issues

- PrimeVue components can't be styled with UnoCSS utility classes. Learn more in
  [this issue](https://github.com/sghuang19/slidev-addon-prime/issues/8).
  Currently the only workaround is make utility classes important. For example,
  `class="!mx-auto"`.
